The terms cluster and outbreak both describe the occurrence of new disease cases within a particular location and time period. The number of cases within a cluster are not necessarily greater than what is expected, however in an outbreak the number of cases does exceed the usual norm. In an outbreak the cases are confirmed to be epidemiologically linked while in a cluster an epidemiological connection is only suspected. Not all clusters are outbreaks, however each cluster needs to be investigated. [Source: https://covid19evidencereviews.saskhealthauthority.ca/en/permalink/coviddoc153]
